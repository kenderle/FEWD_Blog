            <h3>The Horror</h3>
            <p>
                One day I was at home, taking cat naps, chasing sun spots, enjoying my usual things. Hoping for maybe a
                fly to come in when the human did, but not hoping <em>too</em> much.
                <br> When the human did come home, I felt the happy-sad I usually did. Happy at the prospect of an
                overflowing food bowl and sad at giving up my premium couch spot. </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, it was an even worse day than that. The human had torture in mind.

                Cats are naturally clean creatures you see, which is part of the reason I decided to make this blog.
                <br>
                There is no reason for the indignity that is routinely forced upon me and I ask my brethren to rise up
                and <strong>END THIS OPPRESSIVE PRACTICE OF FELINE HYGENIENE SUBVERSION!!!</strong><br></p>
